/*
 * Full Team Chat — the destination for "Open Full Chat →" in the quick
 * popup (spec section 12: "The popup is QUICK CHAT. The full module is FULL
 * CHAT. Do not merge these two experiences.")
 *
 * This is deliberately a thin page: all the real logic (polling, sending,
 * attachments, groups, broadcasts, sound) already lives in ChatWidget.jsx.
 * Duplicating that here would mean two implementations of the same feature
 * to keep in sync, and any bug fixed in one place but not the other. This
 * page renders the exact same component in variant="page", which swaps the
 * floating-popup chrome for a normal in-page panel and — because there's
 * room for it on a full page — shows the conversation list and the active
 * conversation side by side on wider screens, the way the compact popup
 * deliberately does not.
