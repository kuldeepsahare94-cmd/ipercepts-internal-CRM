// empty, and every record's Activities tab was empty.
//
// The generation now lives in services/demoData.js, which produces a CRM that
// looks like it has been in use for a year. This file only decides who may

// Permission repair — Settings → Roles & Permissions can only ever ADD or
// remove rows for roles whose checkbox grid isn't disabled, and Super
// Admin's row is deliberately disabled there (it "always has full access").
// That's fine as long as every module actually has a row for Super Admin —
// but a module added after Super Admin's rows were first seeded (documents,
// templates, proforma invoices, invoices) only gets one if some other
// migration copies or grants it, and if that migration ran before its
// source data existed, or was deployed after the role rows were already
// seeded, Super Admin is left with no row at all for that module — which
// reads to `can(module, action)` exactly like "denied", not "unset". There
// is no in-app way to fix that once it happens, since the one screen that
// edits permissions can't touch Super Admin. This endpoint is that fix: it
// force-sets full access for Super Admin and Admin on the core modules that
// must never be invisible to them, however the gap happened. Safe to run
// any number of times.
